# Davit Sargsyan's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a computer science student and data center engineer. 

## Projects

### Project 1: Smart Homie (https://github.com/DavitSargsyan001/SmartHomie)

SmartHomie is a  home automation mobile application for android devices designed to control Phillips Hue Smart Home Devices such as Smart Light bulb and smart plug. The application empowers users with the capability to manage their smart devices effortlessly from their android phone. Whether it's adding or removing smart devices, checking their status, or invoking preset scenarios, SmartHomie puts the user in control.

### Project 2: Football-Predictor (https://github.com/DavitSargsyan001/Football-Predictor)

This project was part of a semester-long data mining class, developed collaboratively with a classmate. The aim was to predict football match outcomes using various data mining techniques. We used the R programming language for web scraping, data cleaning, visualization, and applying machine learning models.

### Project 3: Mobile Board (https://github.com/DavitSargsyan001/MobileBoard)

The primary motivation behind choosing to develop a scrum board mobile application stems from the observation that agile methodologies, particularly scrum, have become ubiquitous in project management across various industries. These methodologies promote flexibility, continuous improvement, and a high level of collaboration. However, teams, especially those working remotely, often face challenges in maintaining effective communication and organization. This project aims to address these challenges by providing a mobile solution that allows team members to seamlessly manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate in real-time, thereby enhancing productivity and ensuring the successful execution of projects.

### Project 4: "HILO Shoes" - E-commerce Desktop Application (https://github.com/DavitSargsyan001/E-commerce)

"HILO Shoes" is a Java-based desktop application developed as a project for the COMP 380 Introduction to Software Engineering class at California State University Northridge. The application simulates an E-commerce shoes store, providing users with features such as product browsing, user registration, shopping cart management, and order placement.

The primary goal of this project is to apply software engineering principles, design patterns, and best practices to build a functional and well-structured application. The application uses Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, Swing for GUI components, and Git for version control.
